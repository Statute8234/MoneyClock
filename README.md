# About

The project is a simulation that mimics a stock market environment, allowing users to interact by purchasing random letters. It uses the pygame library to create a GUI, allowing users to observe price fluctuations over time. Each purchase triggers the addition of a new item with a randomly generated combination of letters, displayed on a circular price chart and a line graph.

# Features

The stock market simulation project offers a virtual stock market environment where users can interact by purchasing random letters representing stocks or assets. The project uses the Pygame library to create a graphical user interface (GUI) that allows users to observe price fluctuations and other market dynamics. The GUI displays a circular price chart and line graph, allowing users to track trends and make informed decisions. Additionally, each purchase triggers the addition of a new item, represented by randomly generated letter combinations, likely serving as unique identifiers for the assets. This project provides an intriguing way to explore stock market dynamics in a simulated environment, allowing users to experiment with buying and selling virtual assets.

# Rating

The code is rated 8/10 for its functionality, organization, comments, user interaction, and dynamic content. It creates scrollable rectangles with dynamic content, generates random combinations of letters, and displays a rotating price line. The code is organized into classes and functions, making it easier to understand the purpose of each part. The code provides adequate comments throughout, allowing users to trigger actions like purchasing and scrolling. The code generates random combinations of letters and updates the content of the rectangles and the price line.
However, there are areas for improvement. The use of global variables should be minimized to make the code easier to understand and maintain. Code readability should be improved by breaking longer sections into smaller functions with descriptive names. Error handling mechanisms should be implemented, especially in unexpected errors like file loading or user input. The UI design should be more visually appealing and organized, with better color schemes and layout designs. Performance optimization should be considered, especially when dealing with large entities or complex computations. Consistent naming conventions for variables, functions, and classes should be ensured to maintain clarity and readability. Refactoring could be done for better efficiency or to remove redundancy. Overall, the code demonstrates good functionality and organization, but improvements are needed to enhance readability, maintainability, and user experience.
