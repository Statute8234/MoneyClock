# About

The project is a simulation that mimics a stock market environment, allowing users to interact by purchasing random letters. It uses the pygame library to create a GUI, allowing users to observe price fluctuations over time. Each purchase triggers the addition of a new item with a randomly generated combination of letters, displayed on a circular price chart and a line graph.

# Features

The stock market simulation project offers a virtual stock market environment where users can interact by purchasing random letters representing stocks or assets. The project uses the Pygame library to create a graphical user interface (GUI) that allows users to observe price fluctuations and other market dynamics. The GUI displays a circular price chart and line graph, allowing users to track trends and make informed decisions. Additionally, each purchase triggers the addition of a new item, represented by randomly generated letter combinations, likely serving as unique identifiers for the assets. This project provides an intriguing way to explore stock market dynamics in a simulated environment, allowing users to experiment with buying and selling virtual assets.

# Rating

The project effectively depicts stock market dynamics through visuals and user interaction, but lacks depth in gameplay and features. The interface could be more intuitive, with tutorials or feedback systems for enhanced engagement. The simulation could benefit from more sophisticated algorithms for realistic price fluctuations. Despite its potential, further development is needed for a compelling simulation experience.
